    r"""Calculates an importance sampling estimate of the unsupervised or
    semi-supervised evidence lower bound (ELBO) as described in [2].
    Given a set of unobserved variables
    .. math:: \boldsymbol{z} = \{z^{1}, z^{2} \cdots z^{M} \}
    The (HFVAE) ELBO expands as:
    .. math::
       &E_{q( \boldsymbol{z} | x,  \boldsymbol{y})} \left[ \log p(x |  \boldsymbol{y},  \boldsymbol{z}) \right] \\
       &- \beta_{1} E_{q(z | x, y)}
       \left[ \sum_{i=1}^{M} \left[ \log \frac{q(z^{i})}{\prod_{d=1}^{D}q(z^{j}_{d})}
       - \log \frac{p(z^{i})}{\prod_{d=1}^{D} p(z^{j}_{d})} \right] \right] \\
       &- \beta_{2} E_{q(z | x, y)} \left[ \sum_{i=1}^{M} \sum_{d=1}^{D} \log \frac{q(z^{i}_{d})}{p(z^{i}_{d})} \right] \\
       &- \beta_{3} E_{q(z | x, y)} \left[ \log \frac{q(\boldsymbol{z} | x, \boldsymbol{y})}{q(\boldsymbol{z})} \right] \\
       &- \beta_{4} E_{q(z | x, y)} \left[ \log \frac{q(\boldsymbol{z})}{\prod_{i=1}^{M} q(z^{i})} -
       \log \frac{p(\boldsymbol{z})}{\prod_{i=1}^{M} p(z^{i})} \right] \\
       &- \beta_{5} E_{q(z | x, y)} \left[ \log \frac{q(\boldsymbol{y} | x)}{p(\boldsymbol{y})} \right] \\
       &+ (\beta_{5} + \alpha) E_{q(z | x)}\left[ \log \frac{q(\boldsymbol{y}, \boldsymbol{z}| x)}{q(\boldsymbol{z} | x)} \right]
    The sets of variables :math:`x`, :math:`y` and :math:`z` refer to:
        :math:`x`: The set of conditioned nodes that are present in `p` but
        are not present in `q`.
        :math:`y`: The set of conditioned nodes in `q`, which may or may
        not also be present in `q`.
        :math:`z`: The set of sampled nodes present in both `q` and `p`.
    Importance sampling is used to approximate the expectation over
    :math:`q(z| x,y)`.
    Distribution :math:`q_{avg}(z)` is the average encoding distribution of the elements in the batch:
    .. math:: q(z^{(s,b)}) \approx \frac{1}{N} q(z^{(s,b)} | x^{(b)}) + \frac{N-1}{N}\frac{1}{B-1} \sum_{b'=1}^{B-1}q(z^{(s,b)} | x^{(b')})
    Or in the supervised case:
    .. math:: q(z^{(s,b)}) \approx \frac{1}{N} q(z^{(s,b)} | x^{(b)}, y^{(b)}) + \frac{N-1}{N}\frac{1}{B-1} \sum_{b'=1}^{B-1}q(z^{(s,b)} | x^{(b')}, y^{(b')})
    Arguments:
        q(:obj:`Trace`): The encoder trace.
        p(:obj:`Trace`): The decoder trace.
        sample_dim(int, optional): The dimension containing individual samples.
        batch_dim(int, optional): The dimension containing batch items.
        alpha(float, default 0.1): Coefficient for the ML term.
        beta(tuple, default (1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0)): Coefficients (length 5) for the KL term.
        size_average (bool, optional): By default, the objective is averaged
            over items in the minibatch. When set to false, the objective is
            instead summed over the minibatch.
        reduce (bool, optional): By default, the objective is averaged or
           summed over items in the minibatch. When reduce is False, losses
           are returned without averaging or summation.
        bias (float): Bias correction term. Should be set to (N - 1) / (B - 1),
           where N is the size of the full data set and B is the batch size.
